              <h2>Hazardous Cargo Reporting</h2>
              <p>
                The shipping Manifest is one of the key documents in the
                shipping process and is generally used by many players across
                the community. As the new central hub, the PCS will receive
                manifests from Shipping Agents in various formats, validate with
                Customs and then deliver them to other important stakeholders.
                For those players who cannot send manifests in any of the
                traditional industry file formats, the PCS provides a standard
                online user interface which enables fast and convenient creation
                as well as submission of manifests and related documentation. It
                will also cater to the amendment of manifests and the management
                of payments, where deemed necessary by Customs.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a single window for manifest submission and dissemination,
                the PCS will substantially reduce paper-pushing efforts across
                the community. This is because industry players have
                traditionally received and re-created a lot of this data for
                their own purposes, often introducing errors and subsequent
                delays in the goods movement process.

                  Where necessary, the PCS will share with the relevant
                  stakeholders and authorities based on their role:
                </h6>

                </ul>
              </div>
              <h6>Benefits (Shipping Agents)</h6>
              <p>
                Traditionally, large shipping Agents with greater resources
                would prepare manifests via their own custom-built applications.
                Changes and upgrades over time were expensive and sometimes
                impossible. These pain points were further propagated whenever
                starting up Operations in a new country or port. Smaller agents,
                on the other hand, would use basic but inadequate software tools
                such as Microsoft Excel. Unfortunately, neither approach was
                suitable nor sustainable for compatibility and financial
                reasons. Additionally, in sharing these documents they would
                have to subsequently e-mail and/or send physical copies to
                different stakeholders, located in geographically diverse areas.
                Oftentimes, errors and changes would result in painstaking
                attempts to fix or amend and re-submit the documentation. This
                proved inefficient and uneconomical for business.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS is adaptable and flexible in accepting a wide array of
                file and transmission types, easing this burden. In that regard,
                it is designed to simplify the manifest creation and
                dissemination process. Along with smaller agents, those
                companies with pre-existing systems may opt to utilize their
                native formats and may even choose to utilize the PCS'
                application instead of their own. The PCS will automatically
                ensure accuracy while handling dissemination activities in a
                timely manner. Subsequent amendments can be handled in the PCS
                and can be immediately paid for via our online payment platform.
                For those agents performing frequent repeat transactions, the
                PCS will allow them to duplicate pre-existing manifests easily,
                substantially cutting the time and effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                In ongoing business, NVOCC's would need to await the main
                agent's submission of the main manifest before they could
                prepare and submit their manifests to Customs. This resulted in
                issues with Customs, sometimes causing them to be breached if
                they submitted after the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS allows NVOCC's to prepare their manifests and save in
                draft mode well ahead of the main agents’ submission of their
                own manifest. This allows them to complete the mass of their own
                work ahead of the stipulated deadline. Once the main manifest
                has been accepted by Customs, NVOCC’s can easily submit their
                manifests as well.
              </p>
              <h6>Customs</h6>

                The shipping Manifest is one of the key documents in the

              <p>
                Traditionally, large shipping Agents with greater resources
                would prepare manifests via their own custom-built applications.
                Changes and upgrades over time were expensive and sometimes
                impossible. These pain points were further propagated whenever
                starting up Operations in a new country or port. Smaller agents,
                on the other hand, would use basic but inadequate software tools
                such as Microsoft Excel. Unfortunately, neither approach was
                suitable nor sustainable for compatibility and financial
                reasons. Additionally, in sharing these documents they would
                have to subsequently e-mail and/or send physical copies to
                different stakeholders, located in geographically diverse areas.
                Oftentimes, errors and changes would result in painstaking
                attempts to fix or amend and re-submit the documentation. This
                proved inefficient and uneconomical for business.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS is adaptable and flexible in accepting a wide array of
                file and transmission types, easing this burden. In that regard,
                it is designed to simplify the manifest creation and
                dissemination process. Along with smaller agents, those
                companies with pre-existing systems may opt to utilize their
                native formats and may even choose to utilize the PCS'
                application instead of their own. The PCS will automatically
                ensure accuracy while handling dissemination activities in a
                timely manner. Subsequent amendments can be handled in the PCS
                and can be immediately paid for via our online payment platform.
                For those agents performing frequent repeat transactions, the
                PCS will allow them to duplicate pre-existing manifests easily,
                substantially cutting the time and effort.

                In ongoing business, NVOCC's would need to await the main
                agent's submission of the main manifest before they could
                prepare and submit their manifests to Customs. This resulted in
                issues with Customs, sometimes causing them to be breached if
                they submitted after the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS allows NVOCC's to prepare their manifests and save in
                draft mode well ahead of the main agents’ submission of their
                own manifest. This allows them to complete the mass of their own
                work ahead of the stipulated deadline. Once the main manifest
                has been accepted by Customs, NVOCC’s can easily submit their
                manifests as well.

                For those players who cannot send manifests in any of the

                Traditionally, large shipping Agents with greater resources
                would prepare manifests via their own custom-built applications.
                Changes and upgrades over time were expensive and sometimes
                impossible. These pain points were further propagated whenever
                starting up Operations in a new country or port. Smaller agents,
                on the other hand, would use basic but inadequate software tools
                such as Microsoft Excel. Unfortunately, neither approach was
                suitable nor sustainable for compatibility and financial
                reasons. Additionally, in sharing these documents they would
                have to subsequently e-mail and/or send physical copies to
                different stakeholders, located in geographically diverse areas.
                Oftentimes, errors and changes would result in painstaking
                attempts to fix or amend and re-submit the documentation. This
                proved inefficient and uneconomical for business.

                The PCS is adaptable and flexible in accepting a wide array of

                it is designed to simplify the manifest creation and
                dissemination process. Along with smaller agents, those
                companies with pre-existing systems may opt to utilize their
                native formats and may even choose to utilize the PCS'
                application instead of their own. The PCS will automatically
                ensure accuracy while handling dissemination activities in a
                timely manner. Subsequent amendments can be handled in the PCS
                and can be immediately paid for via our online payment platform.
                For those agents performing frequent repeat transactions, the
                PCS will allow them to duplicate pre-existing manifests easily,

                In ongoing business, NVOCC's would need to await the main
                agent's submission of the main manifest before they could
                prepare and submit their manifests to Customs. This resulted in
                issues with Customs, sometimes causing them to be breached if
                they submitted after the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS allows NVOCC's to prepare their manifests and save in
                draft mode well ahead of the main agents’ submission of their
                own manifest. This allows them to complete the mass of their own

                shipping process and is generally used by many players across
                the community. As the new central hub, the PCS will receive
                manifests from Shipping Agents in various formats, validate with
                Customs and then deliver them to other important stakeholders.
                For those players who cannot send manifests in any of the
                traditional industry file formats, the PCS provides a standard
                online user interface which enables fast and convenient creation
                as well as submission of manifests and related documentation. It
                will also cater to the amendment of manifests and the management
                of payments, where deemed necessary by Customs.

                Traditionally, large shipping Agents with greater resources
                would prepare manifests via their own custom-built applications.
                Changes and upgrades over time were expensive and sometimes
                impossible. These pain points were further propagated whenever
                starting up Operations in a new country or port. Smaller agents,
                on the other hand, would use basic but inadequate software tools
                such as Microsoft Excel. Unfortunately, neither approach was
                suitable nor sustainable for compatibility and financial
                reasons. Additionally, in sharing these documents they would
                have to subsequently e-mail and/or send physical copies to
                different stakeholders, located in geographically diverse areas.
                Oftentimes, errors and changes would result in painstaking
                attempts to fix or amend and re-submit the documentation. This

                The PCS is adaptable and flexible in accepting a wide array of

                it is designed to simplify the manifest creation and

                native formats and may even choose to utilize the PCS'

                ensure accuracy while handling dissemination activities in a
                timely manner. Subsequent amendments can be handled in the PCS
                and can be immediately paid for via our online payment platform.
                For those agents performing frequent repeat transactions, the
                PCS will allow them to duplicate pre-existing manifests easily,

                In ongoing business, NVOCC's would need to await the main
                agent's submission of the main manifest before they could
                prepare and submit their manifests to Customs. This resulted in
                issues with Customs, sometimes causing them to be breached if
                they submitted after the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS allows NVOCC's to prepare their manifests and save in
                draft mode well ahead of the main agents’ submission of their
                own manifest. This allows them to complete the mass of their own

                would prepare manifests via their own custom-built applications.
                Changes and upgrades over time were expensive and sometimes
                impossible. These pain points were further propagated whenever
                starting up Operations in a new country or port. Smaller agents,
                on the other hand, would use basic but inadequate software tools
                such as Microsoft Excel. Unfortunately, neither approach was
                suitable nor sustainable for compatibility and financial
                reasons. Additionally, in sharing these documents they would
                have to subsequently e-mail and/or send physical copies to
                different stakeholders, located in geographically diverse areas.
                Oftentimes, errors and changes would result in painstaking
                attempts to fix or amend and re-submit the documentation. This
                proved inefficient and uneconomical for business.

                The PCS is adaptable and flexible in accepting a wide array of
                file and transmission types, easing this burden. In that regard,
                it is designed to simplify the manifest creation and
                dissemination process. Along with smaller agents, those
                companies with pre-existing systems may opt to utilize their
                native formats and may even choose to utilize the PCS'
                application instead of their own. The PCS will automatically
                ensure accuracy while handling dissemination activities in a
                timely manner. Subsequent amendments can be handled in the PCS
                and can be immediately paid for via our online payment platform.
                For those agents performing frequent repeat transactions, the
                PCS will allow them to duplicate pre-existing manifests easily,
                substantially cutting the time and effort.

              <p>
                In ongoing business, NVOCC's would need to await the main
                agent's submission of the main manifest before they could
                prepare and submit their manifests to Customs. This resulted in
                issues with Customs, sometimes causing them to be breached if
                they submitted after the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCS allows NVOCC's to prepare their manifests and save in
                draft mode well ahead of the main agents’ submission of their
                own manifest. This allows them to complete the mass of their own
                work ahead of the stipulated deadline. Once the main manifest
                has been accepted by Customs, NVOCC’s can easily submit their
                manifests as well.

              <h6>Customs</h6>
              <p>
                Given that Shipping agents across the industry utilized
                different methods of creating and submitting manifests, the lack
                of uniformity resulted in significant administrative and
                technical efforts for Customs, leaving them to deal with
                numerous inconsistencies in translating electronic files and
                handling manual prints. In dealing with the resulting issues,
                personnel were dedicated to supporting manifest submissions in
                their Asycuda and eManifest systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given that the PCS will centralize and optimize manifest
                submissions across the port community, Customs will see the
                benefits of on-time submissions across its valuation and risk
                management teams who can now utilize the manifest information in
                a more proactive manner.

                The shipping Manifest is one of the key documents in the
                shipping process and is generally used by many players across
                the community. As the new central hub, the PCS will receive
                manifests from Shipping Agents in various formats, validate with
                Customs and then deliver them to other important stakeholders.
                For those players who cannot send manifests in any of the
                traditional industry file formats, the PCS provides a standard
                online user interface which enables fast and convenient creation
                as well as submission of manifests and related documentation. It
                will also cater to the amendment of manifests and the management
                of payments, where deemed necessary by Customs.

                As a single window for manifest submission and dissemination,
                the PCS will substantially reduce paper-pushing efforts across
                the community. This is because industry players have
                traditionally received and re-created a lot of this data for
                their own purposes, often introducing errors and subsequent
                delays in the goods movement process.
